# Data-Analysis-on-Banking-Dataset

This asssignment aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this assignment, apart from applying EDA , we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Nowdays Banks and Financial companies find it very difficult the give loan to their customers , because of high defaulter rate and lack of credit score's of the customers.
